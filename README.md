Hi, I'm Phillip.

I am an honors student at Boston University studying computer science. I'm
currently working at Atllas, Inc. as a consultant.

Within the world of software enginneering, I am most interest in crafting
beautiful, functional web applications and developing robust, adaptable
computer vision systems for robots.

I am heavily involved in student organizations. I'm serving as the Director of
Marketing in Upsilon Pi Epsilon, a computer science honor society. I am also
the team captain of the Boston University Valorant B Team.

If I'm not programming, you'll find me co-hosting podcasts or making music with
my band.
