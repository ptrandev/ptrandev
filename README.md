Hi, I'm Phillip.

I am a graduate student at Boston University studying computer science. I'm
currently working at Atllas, Inc. as a full stack developer, where I develop
tools that enable billions of dollars worth of real estate transactions.

Within the world of software engineering, I am most interest in crafting
beautiful, functional web applications and developing robust, adaptable
computer vision systems for robots. Check out my personal projects here.

I am heavily involved in student organizations. I am the Vice President of
BUILDS, a student run hackerspace. I have served as the Director of Marketing
in Upsilon Pi Epsilon, a computer science honor society.

If I'm not programming, you'll find me working on my music or co-hosting
podcasts. Go ahead and check out my media involvement here.

Outside of those things, I enjoy personal finance, fitness, cooking, and
watches. I love staying curious!
